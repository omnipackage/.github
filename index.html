    <h1 class="display-6 fw-bold mb-4">We had centralized software repositories long before AppStore. Why is it still so hard to build and distribute software for Linux?</h1>

    <h2 class="col-md-8 fs-4">OmniPackage combines CI with repositories and set of tools to simplify the process of creating and distributing your own RPM and DEB packages for many distros easily using native package managers. It's open source.</h2>

  <h2>What it does</h2>
  <p>Helps you create RPM spec-file and set of files for DEB. The files are actually templates to support multiple distros at once</p>
  <p>Spawns <code>rpmbuild</code> and <code>dpkg-buildpackage</code> inside containers to build your packages for each supported distro</p>
  <p>Signs the packages via GPG key and uploads them to s3-compatible storage which serves as a respository</p>
  <p>Generates a web page which you can share with your users where they can choose their distro, add the repository and install your package</p>

  <h2>No vendor lock</h2>
  <p>It is <a href="{{ site.github_url }}" target="_blank">open source</a> and you can self-host it</p>
  <p>You can use your own s3 bucket for respoitories and thus switch to self-hosted version any time without changing respositories' URLs (i.e. your users noticing this)</p>

  <h2>No subscription</h2>
  <p>Pay only for storage and CPU when building</p>
  <p>You can host your own build agent</p>
  <p>You can use your own s3-compatible storage</p>
