    OmniPackage helps you create RPM spec files and similar sets of files for DEB. For building, it spawns <code>rpmbuild</code> and <code>dpkg-buildpackage</code> inside containers for each supported distro. After building, it signs the packages via GPG key and uploads them to S3-compatible storage, which serves as a respository. Finally, it generates a web page with instructions on how to add the repository and install your package. You can share a link to this page with your users.

  <h2>No vendor lock</h2>
  <p>It is <a href="{{ site.github_url }}" target="_blank">open source</a> and you can self-host it</p>
  <p>You can use your own s3 bucket for respoitories and thus switch to self-hosted version any time without changing respositories' URLs (i.e. your users noticing this)</p>

  <h2>No subscription</h2>
  <p>Pay only for storage and CPU when building</p>
  <p>You can host your own build agent</p>
  <p>You can use your own s3-compatible storage</p>
